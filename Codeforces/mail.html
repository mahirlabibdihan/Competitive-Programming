        Dear Abir,
        <br>Hope you are doing great. Tomorrow is your first class at the "Land of Living" and I honestly hope it will be a nice one.
        <br> So yeah, WELCOME TO BUET! And congratulations for making it this far. You are going to experience new things, make new friends and I can assure you this journey is going to be amazing! You will get a friendly and cooperative environment in
        studies. So don't just sit in the corner keeping confusions in your mind, rather feel free to contact any senior about your problems, especially me. I was in your place one day and It's been almost two years since I've been in Buet. So, I have
        gone through the difficulties and problems you will face. If you face any problems in your campus life or if you need any suggestions about your academics don't hesitate to contact me. I will try to help as much as I can. Stay connected.
        <br>I wish you a very happy and blessed life ahead. Be ambitious and dream big. </h3>
